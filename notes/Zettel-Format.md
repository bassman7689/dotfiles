# Zettel Format

#zettelkasten #notes #zettel

A Zettel is a single note. Each note should have a unique id (in my case a little of what the note is about).
I then add a title at the top of each not with mostly the same information as the title of the file. After that,
I add "hashtags" (read: tags for the information) that help tag what the note contains. Finally, I add the note
information itself, With 3 sections Zettel Links (links to other relavent Zettels), References (the places I got
the information in the note), and Backlinks (links back to notes that link to this note).
