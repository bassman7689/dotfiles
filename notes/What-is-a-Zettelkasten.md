# What is a Zettelkasten?

#zettelkasten #notes

A Zettelkasten is some kind of hypertext note taking web. It enphasizes forming relationships between notes.
It makes connecting information a priority, not just collecting it. The difference between normal notes and 
takes notes with a Zettelkasten is the information goes from growing linearly (meaning in time) to organically
(meaning it grows like a web in this case). A Zettelkasten is a collection of notes linked together that form
a web of information. Each note must have a unique id and should link to other notes.
